# OER-Forge

Open-source tools for education. Built because we needed them.

## About

OER-Forge is a collection of tools created to solve real problems in teaching and learning. Each tool is independent and focused on doing one thing well.

## Tools

* **WikiAccess** – Convert DokuWiki pages to accessible, WCAG 2.1 compliant documents. Exports to HTML, Word (.docx), and Markdown. Handles images, LaTeX equations, and generates accessibility reports. Useful for converting course materials into multiple formats while ensuring they're accessible to everyone.
* **RaiseMyHand** – Real-time classroom question management. Students submit questions anonymously and upvote each other's questions—like Reddit, but for your classroom. Instructors get a dashboard to see, moderate, and respond to the most important questions. Built with FastAPI, WebSockets, and works with Docker. Designed for lectures, labs, seminars, and online courses.

## Philosophy

Build tools that solve actual problems. Keep them simple. Make them accessible. Release as open source so others can use and improve them.
